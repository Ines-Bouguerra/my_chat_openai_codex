# My Chat Open AI Codex

This is a chatbot that uses the advanced API of the GPT3 model to generate responses to user input. It is a work in progress, and I am still working on improving the quality of the responses.
A user interface that looks like the ChatGPT application, communication with the advanced API of the GPT3 model, and most importantly, the ability to ask the AI for help with JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, give it code and translate it into another programming language, and much more.
