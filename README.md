# My Chat Open AI Codex

This is a chatbot that uses the advanced API of the GPT3 model to generate responses to user input. It is a work in progress, and I am still working on improving the quality of the responses.
A user interface that looks like the ChatGPT application, communication with the advanced API of the GPT3 model, and most importantly, the ability to ask the AI for help with JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, give it code and translate it into another programming language, and much more.

## Installation

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Ines-Bouguerra/my_chat_openai_codex.git

    cd my_chat_openai_codex/client
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

```bash
    cd my_chat_openai_codex/server
    npm install
    npm start
```

## Note

```bash
    You need to create a .env file in the server folder and add your OpenAI API key to it.
    You can get your API key from https://beta.openai.com/
```

```bash
    please note that the server link used in the Codex repository shared on GitHub has used all of its credits, so it will throw a 429 error and will not work. You will need to use your own server link by deploying it on Render or using another hosting service.
```	

```bash
    You can find the link to the app here: https://my-chat-openai-codex.vercel.app/
```
## Usage

```bash
    You can use the chatbot to ask it questions about JavaScript, React, or any other programming language.
    You can also give it code and ask it to translate it into another programming language.
    You can also ask it to generate code for you.
```
